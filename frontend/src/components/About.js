          <hr className="aboutHr"/>
          My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, and I have had the opportunity to dive deep into various programming languages and technologies, including Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript. My coursework has included advanced studies in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles, preparing me for complex problem-solving and innovative solutions.

          During my co-op at Danbury Mission Technologies, I developed an embedded software program to enhance communication between satellite payload components, honing my skills in both high-level and low-level programming. Additionally, I led the development of an AI Mental Health Chatbot, a scalable web application offering 24/7 multilingual support. Built with Next.js and deployed on AWS EC2, the app utilizes OpenAI GPT-3.5 for intelligent, empathetic responses. As project lead, I managed a team of four using Scrum methodology, focusing on delivering a reliable and impactful mental health solution.

          Outside of my academic and professional life, I have a range of hobbies that keep me engaged and inspired. I love reading, watching foreign films, and learning new languages, which broadens my perspectives and keeps my creativity flowing. Hiking and spending time in nature allow me to recharge and find balance, while swimming and drawing in charcoal are my favorite ways to unwind and express myself artistically.
          <hr className="aboutHr"/>
          I am passionate about combining technology with creativity and am excited to continue exploring how innovative solutions can address real-world challenges!
